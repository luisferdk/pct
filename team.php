                <h4>Corporate Magician</h4>
                <h5>Thomas</h5>
                  <span>Thomas, a.k.a T.J. or T-money (don't ask) is the guy in charge of groups at Caribbean Dream. Thomas is a Dominican/American with nearly a decade of experience working in Dominican Republic tourism. Thomas, like everyone at Caribbean Dream, deeply understands the importance of service and response time. If for any reason, you don't receive a laser fast response to your phone call or email, give him a few, he's probably catching one more wave at Macao Beach in Punta Cana.</span>

                <h4>Chief Amazement Officer</h4>
                <h5>Garry</h5>
                  <span>Originally from Haiti, Garry is our operations godfather with a decade of experience in Punta Cana tourism. Locally, Garry knows everyone. You want something? He makes it happen - bada bing, bada boom! To ensure first class service, Garry is reachable 24 hours a day; at times it seems like both him and his cell phone never sleep. If he doesn't answer, don't freak out, he's probably taking a walk on Bavaro Beach and he'll have his people call your people right away.</span>

                  <span>Meet Len, our Canadian Accountant.  You know he’s the Accountant because he is the only white guy on the beach with a laptop while working on his tan.  He is truly committed to Caribbean Dream’s success and ensures that we continue to provide a value added service now, and in the years to come!</span>

                <h5>Julio</h5>
                  <span>After traveling the world by high sea working on cruise ships, Julio comes to Caribbean Dream fresh off the boat. With the voice of a smooth operator, and a gentlemanly demeanor, Julio aka Kiko, is in charge of all things customer service. Born and bred in the Dominican Republic, Julio helps the Caribbean Dream office maintain our balance of Dominican Flow. After visiting destinations far and wide he has developed a passion for helping people discover one of his favorite places, Punta Cana.  </span>

           <h4>The Enforcer</h4>
           <h5>Blondie</h5>
             <span>Blondie is a sweetheart with our team at Caribbean Dream and stops by the office every once in awhile to lift company moral. But don't let that cute face fool you - Blondie has a dark side.  A vicious mix of Collie, Golden Retriever and Dominican Terrier, we utilize her hidden ferociousness for clients who are no shows for their tours or for those who try and pass us bum credit cards. You've been forewarned.</span>

                  <span>Ken works hard but tries not to take himself too seriously. Born in Germany, he grew up in California but calls the Dominican Republic his home. Whenever he has some free time, he's jumping on a plane to explore another unique corner of this world. An avid diver, he feels more at home swimming with sharks than watching TV. Oh yeah, he's also the guy that sort of keeps this site from falling apart.</span>

Sitting behind his computer somewhere in Siberia, Alex is a master programmer who is constantly debugging, testing, maintaining source code, generating algorithms and a bunch of other things too difficult to pronounce or understand. Alex has a long standing relationship with the owners of Caribbean Dream and is vital to the company's online success. He denies being a communist.</span>
